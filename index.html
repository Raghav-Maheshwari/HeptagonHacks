    <h1 class="w3-center title"><b>Looking for a unique summer opportunity where you'll take the lead?</b> 
    </h1>

        <h3 class="description">Heptagon Hacks is a week long summer program for ZIS students hosted by Heptagon AG. It is capped off with a 24-hour “Internet of Things” hackathon. During this time, students will work in teams to implement and execute IoT projects using Heptagon’s hardware kits, while having access to resources and guidance throughout. Most importantly the hackathon will be a time to generate cool IoT ideas and learn something new!
        
        </h3>
        
        <h1 class="w3-center title">Why should you apply?</h1>
        <h3 class="description">
        A: because it will give you an opportunity to work on something you actually want to. Also, engineering internships are always hard to come by in high school because you don't have that much technical experience - in this case, we want the internship to be a learning experience so that you can walk away from it a better engineer! <br>
        </h3>
        <h3 class="description">
B: This is the perfect opportunity for you to learn more about coding if you're interested but never had the time - even if you don't see yourself majoring in computer science at Uni, it's an increasingly important skill to have in any discipline, from finance to bio-engineering .

        </h3>
        <h3 class="description">
C: Participating in a unique opportunity like this will make you stand out when you apply to universities or future internships - not a lot of high schoolers can say that they've done a hackathon before. 
        
        </h3>
